# Data-Structures-Algorithms-in-Python
This repositry is a part of learning effort. I recently started reading a book on DS & Algo. book name: 
Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repositry contains Project Exercises of each chapter. The problem statement of each project exercise from each chapter is mentioned in the source code as comment.

I will keep on adding solution for new project exercises. As, i continue reading and learning from this book.
